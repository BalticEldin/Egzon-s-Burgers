#Egzon's Burgers

This project is a burger restaurant website for a fictional business called "Egzon's Burgers." It is designed to provide an engaging and responsive user experience with a clean, modern interface. The website showcases the brand, features, and menu items, and includes essential sections such as a header, main content area, and footer. Below is a breakdown of the key components:

#Technologies used:
-HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the page, ensuring the content is well-organized and visually appealing.
-Bootstrap: A CSS framework that aids in making the website responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
-JavaScript: (Currently not utilized fully) This will be implemented for interactivity features in the future, such as a shopping cart or interactive menu items.

#Website Features:
-Header: Contains a fixed-top navigation bar with links to different sections of the website: Home, Menu, and About. The navbar also includes icons for search and cart functionalities (these are placeholders for now).
-Main Section:
-> A section with a featured image and a catchy slogan ("THE ULTIMATE BURGER HAVEN"), introducing visitors to Egzon's Burgers.
-> Buttons for ordering and viewing the menu are placed below the text.
-> Menu Previews: A section with images of different burgers (e.g., Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Egzon's Burger, Onion Burger) linked to the menu page for more details.
-Footer: Contains contact information (email, phone, address) and social media links (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) for users to follow the restaurant's updates.

#Work in Progress:
-The project is still under development, and many features are placeholders at the moment.
-JavaScript functionalities (like cart interaction, menu filtering, etc.) are planned for future updates.
-The content, such as the menu page, product details, and images, is not fully fleshed out.


#Next Steps:
-Implement full JavaScript functionality for interactive features (e.g., adding items to the cart, a search function, etc.).
-Add content for the Menu page, including detailed descriptions of each burger.
-Make the page fully functional and user-friendly by enhancing accessibility and ensuring all links and buttons work as expected.
